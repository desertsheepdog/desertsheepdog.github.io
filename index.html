				<h1>Massage Therapy</h1>

			<div id="massageBody" class="panelBody">
				<div id="massageContent" class="panelContent">
				<p>Massage therapy is becoming mainstream in the area of stress reduction, the easing of aches and pains and the improvement of many health issues. The National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork finds many health benefits from massage including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Reduced blood pressure</li>
					<li>A stronger immune system</li>
					<li>Increased circulation</li>
					<li>Pain, stiffness and chronic back pain relief</li>
					<li>Increased mobility and speed of the healing process</li>
					<li>Easier time through pregnancy</li>
				</ul>
				<p>With high pressure jobs, over-committed obligations and trying to pack three days of priorities into one itâ€™s no wonder we are overstressed. Massage therapy provides a peaceful and tranquil environment where gentle, medium and firm flowing massage strokes are applied to the skin and muscle tissue. These massage strokes stimulate many of our body systems such as the lymphatic, circulatory and cardiovascular system. As the circulatory system is being stimulated through massage the cardiovascular system is sending highly oxygenated blood throughout the body and skin. Toxins and other waste products being held in the body and muscle tissue are being released and carried through our lymphatic system for elimination. Massage has an effect on the nervous system which promotes a sense of well being and calming of the mind which helps in stress reduction and has an effect on the nerves and reflex points in the body enhancing muscle relaxation. It alleviates muscle pain and tension in all areas of the body due to stress, arthritis, fibromyalgia, muscular overexertion and pregnancy just to name a few. Muscle spasms caused by repetitive muscle tension due to working at a computer terminal all day, driving long hours, a job requiring lifting or bending, or being in an airplane for any length of time can be relieved by getting a massage. Flexibility and movement are improved in the joints and muscles which help reduce sports injuries and the discomforts of pregnancy.</p>
				<p>There are many types of massage that can benefit the body and can help with a myriad of chronic conditions and diseases. Why not give it a try? It may be the most wonderful experiences of your life!</p>
				<p>*When searching for a massage therapist, make sure they are licensed with a minimum of 750 hours of study with a certificate of completion.</p>
