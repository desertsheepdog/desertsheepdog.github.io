				<h2>Health</h2>
				<p>All clients are required to complete a health questionnaire so that your service can be customized to your specific needs. Some massage modalities and body treatments are contraindications for certain health issues.</p>
				<h2>Booking Appointments</h2>
				<p>To ensure availability of your preferred time, it is recommended to click the link below to book your appointment at least one week in advance.</p>
				<h2>Cancellations</h2>
				<p>Should you need to cancel your appointment, please call at least 24 hours ahead of your appointment time so I can book someone else in that time slot.</p>
				<h2>Gift Certificates</h2>
				<p>Gift Certificates can be purchased through me or the front desk.</p>
				<h2>Age Requirements</h2>
				<p>The spa is an adult- oriented atmosphere. Clients must be 18 years old to receive body services. I will provide body services to teens at least 16 years old with parental permission.</p>
				<h2>Insurance Billing</h2>
				<p>Payment is expected at time of service. However, I can provide you with a billing statement that you can submit to your insurance company or health savings plan for reimbursement. I accept cash, check and credit cards.</p>
				<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
				<p>I do not diagnose illness, disease or any other physical or mental disorder. Massage therapy is given for the purpose of relaxation, stress reduction, relief from muscular tension, spasm and stiff joints, and increased blood flow and circulation. It is the client's responsibility to inform me of all medical issues past and present including skin conditions, sensitivities, disorders, and allergies especially to fragrances, creams and oils.</p>
